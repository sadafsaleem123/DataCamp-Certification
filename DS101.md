Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to analyze the differences among means. Two types of ANOVA are one-way ANOVA and the two-way ANOVA. The only difference between one-way and two-way ANOVA is the number of independent variables. A one-way ANOVA has one independent variable, while a two-way ANOVA has two.
