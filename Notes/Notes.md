```
import unittest

class TestSampleMethod(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_sum(self):
        
self.assertEqual
(sum(2,2), 4)
```

Explanation:

- The code import unittest at the top of the file imports the unittest module, which provides a framework for writing and running tests.
- The code class TestSampleMethod(unittest.TestCase): defines a new class TestSampleMethod that inherits from unittest.TestCase. This makes TestSampleMethod a test case, which allows us to run tests and make assertions about the behavior of the code we are testing.

The code def test_sum(self): defines a method test_sum inside TestSampleMethod. This method is a test case and will be executed as part of the test suite.

The line self.assertEqual(sum(2,2), 4) is the actual test. It uses the assertEqual method of the TestCase class to make an assertion about the expected behavior of the sum method. The assertEqual method takes two arguments and checks if they are equal. In this case, it checks if sum(2,2) returns 4. If the assertion passes, the test is considered to have passed. If the assertion fails, the test is considered to have failed and an error will be reported.


In data science, unit tests are used to verify that individual pieces of code, such as functions or methods, are working correctly. Unit tests ensure that changes to the code, such as bug fixes or updates, do not break existing functionality.
